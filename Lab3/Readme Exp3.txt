There are two files simulation.slx, hardware.slx. Initially open the simulation.slx file and tune PD control and make sure the specification given in problem statement are met.

Once simulation.slx file is tested. Use the obtained PD parameters and run the hardware.slx file where the interaction with actual hardware is done. 

If additionial noises are observed then design a filter to remove that noise.
