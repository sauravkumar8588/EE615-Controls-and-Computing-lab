EE615 Course Experiments ‚Äì README
Welcome to the EE615 (2025) course experiments repository! This folder contains all materials and code for the four major experiments conducted as part of the EE615 Autonomous Systems curriculum.

üìö Experiments Overview
EXP 1: Swingup and LQR Control

Implement and analyze the pendulum swing-up problem.

Design and tune a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for optimal control.

Visualize system dynamics and stability.

EXP 2: Purepursuit and VFH

Develop autonomous path tracking with the Pure Pursuit algorithm.

Use Vector Field Histogram (VFH) for dynamic obstacle avoidance.

Test navigation accuracy on simulated robot platforms.

EXP 3: Aero

Explore basic aerodynamics relevant to autonomous drones and bots.

Run simulations to visualize lift, drag, and stability properties.

Modify and test design parameters to observe performance changes.

EXP 4: Kalman Filter Experiment

Implement the Kalman Filter for sensor fusion and state estimation.

Compare filtering accuracy on noisy measurement data.

Extend the experiment for multi-sensor and multi-dimensional cases.
